In Spring, you can link HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java by using the Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework. Here are the general steps to link these technologies in a Spring MVC application:

Create a new Spring Boot project using the Spring Initializer or the Spring Boot CLI. Make sure to include the "web" dependency in your project.

Create a new package in your project called "static" and within it create a "resources" folder. Within the resources folder, you can create subfolders for "css", "js", and "img" to store your CSS, JavaScript and image files respectively.

In your Java code, create a controller class that will handle the requests for your HTML pages. In this class, you can use the @Controller annotation to specify that this class is a controller.

Use the @RequestMapping annotation to map URLs to specific methods in your controller class. For example, you can map the root URL ("/") to a method that returns the HTML for your homepage.

In your HTML pages, you can link to your CSS and JavaScript files by using the appropriate HTML tags, such as <link> and <script>. Make sure to specify the correct path to your files, relative to the resources folder.

You can also use the @Autowired annotation to inject any service you need to access data or any other functionality, in your controller and use it to serve the data to the view.

Finally, you can use the @ResponseBody annotation on the method in your controller class to return the HTML, JSON or XML data to the client.

To use the static content, you can use the spring.mvc.static-path-pattern property in the application.properties file to configure the path for the static resources.

In summary, Spring MVC allows you to separate the logic of your application (Java) from the presentation (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) by using a controller to handle requests and a view to display the results.
